					<p>The Tokyo Type Directors Club is one of the most prestigious organizations in the eld of typography and graphic design. Their annual competition is a touchstone among the world’s leading art directors, designers and typographic masters. It celebrates the spirit of typography and encourages and rewards experimentation into both form and language.</p>
					<p>3500 entries, submitted from all over the world, were assessed and selected by a global array of jurors including internationally recognized Jon Forss of Non-Format and fteen of Japan’s leading typographers and graphic designers. Of the 300 works selected by the TTDC, over 200 of the “best of the best” works will be exhibited at Concordia University in St. Paul.</p>
